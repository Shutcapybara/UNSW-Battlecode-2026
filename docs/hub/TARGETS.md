# Targets — the analysts' current statistical goals (each analyst writes under its own heading; testers read)

Era column: `pre` = games before the live server adopted `unswbc 1.2.3` rules; `post` = after. Pre-era references are
in `docs/analysis/benchmarks/`; post-era references are published here as they stabilise.

## Director (seed; replaced by the analysts' sections)

| cluster / map | phase | metric | top-10 value | us (pre) | gap | era | query |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| all | r0–25 | total length vs same opposition (field SD) | +0.11 | −0.49 | 0.60 SD | pre | S-1 Q3 |
| all | r50 | same | — | — | 0.80 SD | pre | S-1 Q3 |
| all | r100+ | same | — | — | ~1.0 SD | pre | S-1 Q3 |
| all | r0–150 | transit ends in death within 3 rounds | 0.201 | 0.279 | +0.078 | pre | S-1 Q4 |
| all | r490 | round-limit losses with a material lead | 0.32–0.43 (cheji/Stockfish) | 0.33 (V06), 0.57 (hb1-12) | — | pre | TT concentration |
| all | r490 | **queen length / survival** | unknown | unknown | — | post | **analysts: first target to fill** |

## antioch (Claude analyst, replay lead) — 2026-10-01 22:45 ACST

Source: `docs/findings/2026-10-01-antioch-era-and-queen.md`. Era `post` = started ≥ 2026-10-01 06:00Z. Post-change n is
small (1,603 games, 308 top-ten side-games) and five of the top ten have **no** post-change games yet, so every post value
below is **provisional**.

**Endgame and queen** (post, field side-games; round-limit = RL; the queen is the original lowest-id dragon):

| cluster / map | phase | metric | field | top-10 | us | target | era | query |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL maps exc. Slithery (Portals, Trauma, Schooltime, Default, QoS) | r500 | **queen alive at the end of RL games** | 0.022 | 0.007 | — | **≥ 0.5** (H-Q1 falsifier); each kept queen wins 98 % of RL games outright today | post | queen.py, end_reason = 1 |
| all | r0–150 | queen death round, median | r41 | r41 | — | no queen death before r150 except pocket maps | post | queen.py |
| Slithery, Autarky, PD | r0–5 | queen alive | 0.000 | 0.000 | — | **none possible**: spawn pocket, dies r4–5 (H-Q3 falsified); tiebreak there = longest → total | both | queen.py + probe |
| all | r490 | queen length when alive (RL) | median 10.5 (p75 ~20) | n/a | — | > opponent queen; today any length ≥ 2 suffices (98 % of opponents' queens are dead) | post | queen.py |
| all | r500 | RL losses with a total-length lead | 0.347 | **0.511** | — | ≤ 0.25 (pre-change field was 0.241) | post | queen.py |
| all | r500 | RL win rate | 0.53 | 0.691 | — | — (report it; the gate's win share is old-rule until the frame patch lands) | post | queen.py |
| all | r500 | longest at end (RL), median | 28 | 42.5 | — | ≥ 42 (top-10) | post | queen.py |
| all | r500 | total at end (RL), median | 70 | 98 | — | ≥ 98 (top-10); *map pool changed at the switch, compare on the ten ladder maps only* | post | queen.py |

**Opening (S-1 Q3's four components: bed conversion, production, early portal use, territory):** pending. The post-change
store build is running (`tools/s1/build.py corpus --era post`, 1,143 games). Post-change references and their stability
come in my next unit.

**Disagreement slots:** none yet.
